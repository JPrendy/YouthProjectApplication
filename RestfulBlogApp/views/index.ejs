       <h1> Welcome to Kilmore West Youth Project CLG (KWYP) </h1>
        The Kilmore West Youth Project is a Company Limited by Guarantee. It was re-established in 2009 to respond to the needs of young people in the Kilmore West area. It is managed by a voluntary management committee made up of local residents and workers from the area.
        
        KWYP is a place of welcome, understanding, support and encouragement for young people living in the community. We aim to enhance the lives of our young people, while we cater for all young people, the Project will proactively seek to support those most at risk of isolation of any form. We hope to encourage the uniqueness of individual(s) within an atmosphere of collective responsibility guided by principle(s) of quality.
        
        Kilmore West Youth Project, the KEEP, is co-funded by the Irish Government and the European Social Fund as part of the ESF Programme for Employability, Inclusion and Learning (PEIL) 2014-2020
